# # Throw Up
Unity game built for UWP

## Info
The game consists of two modes, Survival and Time Attack. 
At any time, to return to the main menu, hit the "Escape" key on pc or the back button on phones/tablets.
### Survival
In Survival, the player needs to score as many points as he can without missing a single one.
Sounds easy, but it gets tricky after a score of 10 and 20.
### Time Attack
The aim of the game here is to get as many baskets in within 30 seconds. 
Each succesful basket adds a second and a half to the timer.
### Scores
For the time being, the scores page is blank as no scores are being saved outside of the game session.
